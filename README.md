# GivenNfindAB

Given an integer N, you want to find two positive integers A and B such that:
A + B = N;
neither A or B may not contain any 0.

Examples:

Given N = 26 your result may return 9 and 17.
Also some other valid results could be for example: 15 and 11, 13 and 13, 5 and 21. 
Result may not return 20 and 6 as it cointains a zero.

Given N = 210 your result may return 178 and 32. 
Also some other valid results could be for example: 27 and 183, 167 and 43, 75 and 135.
Result may not return 100 and 110 or 210 and 0 as it cointains a zero.

Given N = 3, your result may return 2 and 1 or 1 and 2. 
Result may not return 3 and 0 as it cointains a zero.

N integer can be within range 2...500,000.
